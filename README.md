# Welcome to RSHub!
Remote Sensing Hub (RSHub) is a shared cloud computing platform for the remote sensing community to compute microwave scattering properties based on microwave electromagnetic scattering mechanisms.

## Getting Started
RSHub utilizing **tokens** to run, query, and download results. Register your account today to get a token!!

### Steps to run your code
1. Go to [RShub wesite](https://rshub.zju.edu.cn/Login) to register your account and get an access token.
2. Navigate to your scenario and check parameter lists
3. Explore scenario demos for a quick start
      
#### Explore scenario demos
- [x] **[Vegetation demo](https://github.com/zjuiEMLab/rshub/blob/main/demo/Vegetation-demo.ipynb): Uniform vs. Layered Vegetation Brightness Temperature** 🌵🌲🌳🎍🎋🌾

    > This demo compares the brightness temperature from uniformly and nonuniformly distributed vegetation covered land surfaces at 1.41 GHz based on the radiative transfer theory.

- [x] **[Vegetation Validation](https://github.com/zjuiEMLab/rshub/blob/main/demo/Vegetation-Validation.ipynb): Validate passive VRT using SMAPVEX12 data** 🌵🌲🌳🎍🎋🌾

    > This demo validate the modeled brightness temperature at 1.41 from VPT using SMAPVEX12 cite F5 measurements .
- [x] **[Snow demo DMRT-QMS](https://github.com/zjuiEMLab/rshub/blob/main/demo/Snow-demo-DMRT-QMS.ipynb): Brightness temperature and backscatter of a three-layer snow scenario**

    > This demo estimates multilayer brightness temperature and/or backscatter of snow using DMRT-QMS model.

- [x] **[Snow demo DMRT-BIC](https://github.com/zjuiEMLab/rshub/blob/main/demo/Snow-demo-DMRT-BIC.ipynb): Brightness temperature and backscatter of a three-layer Snow scenario**

    > This demo estimates multilayer brightness temperature and/or backscatter of snow using DMRT-BIC model.

- [x] **[Soil Model](https://github.com/zjuiEMLab/rshub/blob/main/demo/Soil-demo-1.ipynb)**
